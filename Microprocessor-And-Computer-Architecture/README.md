# UE23CS251B - Microprocessor and Computer Architecture

## Course Overview
This course explores the design, functionality, and optimization of modern microprocessors and computer systems. It focuses on ARM architecture, pipelining, memory hierarchy, and advanced parallel computing techniques. Students will gain hands-on experience with simulators and microcontroller kits to implement and analyze architectural concepts.
